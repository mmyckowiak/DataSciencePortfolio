# PROJECTS <br />

## COVID-19 Symptoms Data Modeling
The objective of this project is to develop a model that utilizes independent symptoms—such as breathing problems, fever, dry cough, sore throat, runny nose, headaches, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues—to predict whether a patient has been diagnosed with COVID-19. To achieve this, we train and test three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting Tree. Throughout the project, I will summarize each step, including visualization, pre-processing, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and feeding them into each model. Additionally, we use the feature_importances_ function to analyze the significance of each independent variable in predicting COVID-19 diagnoses for each model. Attached below is the .html file of my project. <br />

## Historical Weather Modeling with XGBRegression
The goal of this project is to develop a weather model that uses independent variables—such as sunshine duration, daylight duration, precipitation sum, precipitation hours, month, and year—to predict the average temperature for a given day. The historical data for this project was sourced from https://open-meteo.com/ and pertains to Orem, Utah, spanning the years 2005 to 2025. At each step, I provide a summary of the objectives and explain how these contribute to building a robust and generally accurate weather model. Attached below is the .html file of my project. <br />
